Polymorphism - one object behave in diff way in diff situation
// based on how u create diff instance

2 Types of Polymorphism1:
1. Compile time Polymorphism (early binding);   ---> overloading
2. Runtime Polymorphism (late binding);         ---> overriding

// Dunno which method will be called - all the method overrides in runtime polymorphism - hence this is called dynamic method dispatch
